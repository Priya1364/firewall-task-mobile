Task 4- check firewall in mobile 
# Firewall Internship Task (Mobile Data Only)

## Steps I Did
1. Found my Public IP using “What is my IP”.
2. Tested port 23 (Telnet) and port 22 (SSH) using canyouseeme.org → both blocked by carrier firewall.
3. Documented firewall rules (Block 23, Allow 22) manually.
4. Verified again with yougetsignal.com.
5. Collected all screenshots as evidence.

## Evidence
- 1_my_ip.png → Public IP
- 2_port23_test.png → Port 23 test (canyouseeme)
- 3_port22_test.png → Port 22 test (canyouseeme)
- 4_firewall_rules_written.png → Documented firewall rules
- 5_test23_ygs.png → Port 23 test (yougetsignal)
- 6_test22_ygs.png → Port 22 test (yougetsignal)

## Note
Since I used **mobile data only**, ports like Telnet (23) and SSH (22) were blocked by default by the telecom carrier firewall.  
This still demonstrates the **concept of blocking Telnet and allowing SSH** with proper documentation a23nd evidence.
